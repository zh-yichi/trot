"""
Cholesky chunking for the chunked pt2CCSD energy kernels (pt2ccsd_bar, upt2ccsd,
upt2ccsd_bar).

The kernels scan the two body sum over chunks of nchol_chunk cholesky vectors, so their
peak memory is set by the chunk size rather than by the number of vectors. This module
holds what decides that size:

    Pt2ccsdChunkMeasCfg       the mixed dtypes and the requested nchol_chunk
    resolve_nchol_chunk       the even division of the cholesky index the kernels scan
    Pt2ccsdMemoryModel        bytes(walkers_in_flight, nchol_chunk) of one kernel pass
    pt2ccsd_memory_model      the model of the restricted bar kernel
    upt2ccsd_memory_model     the model of the unrestricted chunk and bar kernels
    plan_pt2ccsd_chunking     split a byte budget between the cholesky and walker chunks
    device_memory_budget_bytes
                              a budget from the device allocator limit, when it reports one

The chunk is chosen against a budget with minimal zero padding (cholesky_u.equal_chunks).
Only when a single cholesky vector per step still does not fit are the walkers chunked,
and the cholesky chunk is then chosen again against the smaller walker count. The walker
chunk count the plan settles on is a floor: the driver's automatic walker chunking may
raise it further after compilation, never lower it.
