        chol_bar = exp_t1 @ chol @ exp_mt1     (per cholesky vector)

    With the hamiltonian carrying the transformation, the trial in the energy kernel is
    the bare reference determinant and the walker becomes exp_t1 @ walker. The estimator
    is unchanged: the same e0, e1 and t2 come out, and the overlap det(mo_t^T walker) is
    literally det((exp_t1 @ walker)[:nocc]), so trial.overlap_r needs no change either.

    What it buys is the greens function: against the bare reference only its occupied
    rows are nonzero, so the kernel carries an (nocc, norb) half green rather than a full
    (norb, norb) one, and every chunk intermediate shrinks with it. What it costs is
    chol_bar, a second copy of the cholesky tensor.

    The bar estimator with a semistochastic cholesky sum in the T2-contracted energy.

    e2_0, and with it e2_2_1 = e2_0 * gt2g, stays exact: it is needed to build the
    sampling proposal anyway and costs only the gl = green.chol contraction. The three
    accumulators that contract with T2 -- e2_2_2_1, e2_2_2_2 and e2_2_3, whose "iajb"
    contractions cost nocc^2 nvir^2 per cholesky vector -- are split into an exactly
    summed head and an importance sampled tail.

    The estimator is unbiased. n_chol_head="full" puts every vector in the head, which
    removes the sampling entirely and reproduces energy_kernel_rw_rh_bar exactly; that is
    the reference to check this against. In that limit no key is drawn and none is needed,
    which is why key is optional and why make_pt2ccsd_meas_ops then declares no stochastic
    kernel: a run with a full head must not even perturb the RNG stream, or it would take
    a different trajectory than the bar run it is meant to reproduce.

    Cholesky vectors are never gathered into a new array here. The head is a contiguous
    prefix, so it is a plain slice shared across the vmap batch, and the sampled tail is
    scanned over *indices* with the gather inside the scan body -- only one chunk of
    walker-dependent vectors is live at a time. Passing gathered vectors as the scan's xs
    instead would materialise the whole n_walkers * n * norb^2 block for the length of the
    scan, and n is the sample count, not bounded by nchol_chunk, so it could not be
