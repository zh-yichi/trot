Assembly for mixed guide/trial AFQMC.

The guide side of a mixed run is an ordinary single-bundle job: the walkers propagate
under the guide wavefunction with the guide's own hamiltonian, ops and propagator. So
setup._assemble_job (restricted hamiltonian) or setup_u.setup_uh (unrestricted one)
builds it unchanged, and JobMixed only adds the trial that the energy is measured
against, plus the cholesky chunk plan of a chunked trial.

    Assemble a runnable mixed AFQMC Job.

    obj_or_staged supplies the GUIDE (a mean field or a StagedInputs with the guide's
    hamiltonian and trial input). trial_input supplies the measurement trial and must be
    staged already (the recipe's stage_trial), since the trial comes from the CC object
    while the guide may come from the mean field under it.

    mixed_precision applies to the guide propagator and to the trial estimator.

    The cholesky chunk of a chunked trial (pt2ccsd_bar, upt2ccsd, upt2ccsd_bar) is sized by
    the recipe's memory model against a byte budget: max_memory (MB) when given, else a
    share of the device allocator limit, else DEFAULT_NCHOL_CHUNK when the backend reports
    no limit. The plan can raise params.n_chunks (the walker chunk count), never lower it,
    and the driver's own automatic walker chunking may raise it further after compiling.
    nchol_chunk, when given, is taken as fixed and only n_chunks is derived.

    Basic usage is through AfqmcMixed rather than this function directly.
