Example: sizing the AFQMC/pt2CCSD energy kernel against a memory budget
=======================================================================

The pt2CCSD energy estimator has a second kernel, energy_kernel_rw_rh_chunk, selected
with trial="pt2ccsd_chunk", that differs from the default one in two ways:

  * it walks the cholesky tensor in chunks of nchol_chunk vectors per scan step, rather
    than one vector at a time
  * it carries the heavy two-body contractions in single precision when asked, and
    accumulates every partial sum back in double

Both are memory/speed trades, and neither is a number anyone should have to guess. Pass
``max_memory`` (MB, per device, as in pyscf) and the estimator's memory model sizes the
chunking for you.

There are two knobs it can turn, and it turns them in this order:

  nchol_chunk   cholesky vectors per scan step -- gives way first
  n_chunks      walker chunks in vmap_chunked  -- rises only as a last resort

Both multiply the same dominant term, so spending the budget on one or the other buys
the same arithmetic. The difference is that walkers in flight *also* batch the work no
cholesky chunk touches -- the greens function, the determinant, the one-body amplitude
contractions -- so the walkers are the last thing to give. Only when a single cholesky
vector per step still does not fit do walkers leave flight, and the cholesky chunk is
then chosen again against the smaller walker count.

See examples/pt2ccsd_api.py for the plain run this builds on.

# =============================================================================
# The model splits the measurement into four terms by how each one scales. With w
# walkers in flight and a chunk of k cholesky vectors:
#
#     bytes(w, k) = resident + w*per_walker + w*k*per_walker_chol
#
# resident         the cholesky tensor and its padded copy, the t2 amplitudes, the
#                  whole walker population -- no chunking touches any of it. Nothing
#                  shared scales with k: the scan slice is a view into the padded copy,
#                  and equal_chunks keeps that copy's padding bounded whatever k is
# per_walker       walker, green, greenp, t2_green and its halves -- the per-walker
#                  work that only n_chunks can reduce
# per_walker_chol  gl_c, lt2g_c, glgp_c, lt2_1, lt2_2 and their mixed-precision casts
#                  -- the term both knobs divide, and the one that dominates at scale
